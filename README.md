#   TETRIS OPTIMIZER

##  Description
This is a program that receives only one argument, a path to a text file which will contain a list of tetrominoes and assemble them in order to create the smallest square possible.

##  Steps
+   [x] Read in the text file specified in the argument.
+   [x] Parse the file contents into a list of tetrominoes.
+   [x] Calculate the total area of all the tetrominoes combined.
+   [x] Calculate the minimum square size needed to fit all the tetrominoes by taking the square root of the total area and rounding up to the nearest integer.
+   [x] Create a 2D grid with dimensions equal to the minimum square size calculated in step 4.
+   [x] Attempt to place each tetromino on the grid in order, starting from the top-left corner and moving across and down.
+   [ ] ðŸš© If a tetromino cannot be placed in its current orientation, try rotating it and/or moving it to a different position until it can be placed. **(IT IS NOT ALLOW TO ROTATE TETROMINO)**
+   [ ] ðŸš© If all orientations and positions have been tried and the tetromino still cannot be placed, backtrack and try a different placement for the previous tetromino. **(IT IS NOT ALLOW TO ROTATE TETROMINO)**
+   [ ] ðŸš© If all possible placements for all tetrominoes have been tried and none of them can be placed, return an error message indicating that it is impossible to assemble the tetrominoes into a square of the required size. **(IT IS NOT AN ISSUE WHEN THERE ARE STILL EMPTY BLOCKS IN THE SQUARE)**
+   [x] If all tetrominoes have been successfully placed on the grid, return the completed grid as output.
